# iOS-ProtocolsDemo

This project basically explains the following things :
* What are protocols
* What are extensions
* Example of using protocols with extension.
* Protocols can be adopted by both classes and structures.
 
Important point to note here is that if a protocol has an extension, and if this protocol is implemented by some class , then that class need not implement the method of this protocol as the extension already has done its work.
